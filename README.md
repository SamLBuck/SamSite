# SamSite — Personal Website

### React + Vite

This is the source code for **Sam Buck’s personal website**, built with React + Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages at **https://sambuck.org**.

The site includes:
- A simple profile header  
- Direct access to my resume  
- A concise list of software and research projects  

This site intentionally keeps the UI minimal and fast while still acting as a stable home for my work and research output.
